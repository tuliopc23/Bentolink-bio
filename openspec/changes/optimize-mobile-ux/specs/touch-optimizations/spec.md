# Touch Optimizations

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Touch-Specific Focus Rings

All interactive elements on mobile MUST display enhanced focus indicators optimized for touch interactions, distinct from pointer/keyboard focus states.

#### Scenario: Touch focus ring is larger and more visible

**Given** the user is on a touch device (pointer: coarse)
**When** an interactive element receives focus
**Then** the focus ring MUST be at least 3px wide
**And** the focus ring MUST have an offset of at least 4px
**And** the focus ring MUST use a high-contrast color (`var(--blue)` or `var(--focus-color)`)
**And** the focus ring MUST meet WCAG 2.1 contrast requirements (3:1 minimum)

#### Scenario: Pointer focus ring is standard

**Given** the user is on a pointer device (pointer: fine)
**When** an interactive element receives focus
**Then** the focus ring MUST be 2px wide
**And** the focus ring MUST have an offset of 2px
**And** the focus ring MUST follow standard focus styling

#### Scenario: Focus rings adapt to interaction method

**Given** the user is on a device that supports both touch and pointer
**When** the user interacts via touch
**Then** touch-specific focus rings MUST be used
**When** the user switches to pointer/keyboard
**Then** standard focus rings MUST be used
**And** the transition MUST be seamless

### Requirement: Minimum Touch Target Sizing

All interactive elements on mobile MUST meet or exceed Apple HIG minimum touch target sizes to ensure usability.

#### Scenario: All touch targets are at least 44x44pt

**Given** an interactive element is rendered on mobile
**When** measuring the element's interactive area
**Then** the width MUST be at least 44px
**And** the height MUST be at least 44px
**And** the measurement MUST include transparent padding if needed
**And** the clickable/tappable area MUST be verified via browser tools

#### Scenario: Small visual elements have extended hit areas

**Given** a visual element (e.g., icon, dot) is smaller than 44x44pt
**When** the element is interactive
**Then** transparent padding MUST extend the hit area to 44x44pt minimum
**And** the visual appearance MUST remain unchanged
**And** the extended area MUST respond to touch events

#### Scenario: Adjacent touch targets have adequate spacing

**Given** multiple interactive elements are adjacent to each other
**When** measuring the spacing between them
**Then** there MUST be at least 8px spacing between hit areas
**Or** the combined hit area MUST not create ambiguous touch zones
**And** users MUST be able to accurately tap each element

### Requirement: Touch Feedback Animations

All interactive elements on mobile MUST provide immediate visual feedback when touched.

#### Scenario: Elements scale down on touch

**Given** the user touches an interactive element
**When** the touch begins (touchstart)
**Then** the element MUST scale down to 0.95-0.98 of original size
**And** the transition MUST be fast (50-100ms)
**And** the transform MUST be GPU-accelerated
**When** the touch ends (touchend)
**Then** the element MUST return to original size
**And** the transition MUST use a spring easing curve

#### Scenario: Elements show opacity change on touch

**Given** the user touches an interactive element
**When** the touch begins
**Then** the element's opacity MAY reduce to 0.8-0.9
**Or** a semi-transparent overlay MAY appear
**And** the transition MUST be synchronized with the scale animation
**When** the touch ends
**Then** the opacity MUST return to normal

#### Scenario: Touch feedback is disabled for reduced motion

**Given** the user has enabled "prefers-reduced-motion"
**When** the user touches an interactive element
**Then** scale animations MUST be disabled
**And** only opacity changes MAY remain
**Or** all touch feedback animations MUST be disabled

### Requirement: Gesture Support and Optimization

The carousel and interactive elements MUST support standard mobile gestures with optimized touch handling.

#### Scenario: Horizontal swipe is smooth and responsive

**Given** the user is viewing the carousel on mobile
**When** the user performs a horizontal swipe gesture
**Then** the carousel MUST scroll immediately with the finger
**And** the scroll MUST have 1:1 tracking (no lag)
**And** momentum MUST continue after finger release
**And** the scroll MUST respect the device's momentum curve

#### Scenario: Vertical scroll is not blocked

**Given** the user is viewing the carousel on mobile
**When** the user performs a vertical swipe gesture
**Then** the page MUST scroll vertically (not horizontally)
**And** the carousel MUST not intercept vertical gestures
**And** the behavior MUST match native scroll behavior

#### Scenario: Pinch-to-zoom is prevented on carousel

**Given** the user is interacting with the carousel on mobile
**When** the user attempts to pinch-to-zoom
**Then** the zoom MUST be prevented within the carousel container
**And** the viewport meta tag MUST include `user-scalable=no` for carousel area
**Or** CSS `touch-action: pan-x` MUST be applied to prevent zoom

### Requirement: Touch Event Optimization

Touch event handling MUST be optimized for performance and battery life.

#### Scenario: Touch events use passive listeners

**Given** touch event listeners are attached
**When** the listeners are registered
**Then** the listeners MUST use `{ passive: true }` where appropriate
**And** scrolling MUST not be blocked by event handlers
**And** the listeners MUST not call `preventDefault()` unless necessary

#### Scenario: Touch events are debounced/throttled

**Given** multiple touch events fire in rapid succession
**When** the handler processes events
**Then** the handler MUST debounce or throttle events to max 60fps
**And** the handler MUST not cause frame drops
**And** the handler MUST use `requestAnimationFrame` for visual updates

### Requirement: Haptic Feedback (Optional Enhancement)

The application MAY provide haptic feedback for key interactions on supported devices.

#### Scenario: Haptic feedback on widget snap

**Given** the device supports the Vibration API or Haptics API
**When** a widget snaps into place in the carousel
**Then** a light haptic pulse MAY be triggered
**And** the pulse MUST be subtle (10-20ms)
**And** the pulse MUST not occur on every scroll, only on snap completion

#### Scenario: Haptic feedback on CTA tap

**Given** the device supports haptic feedback
**When** the user taps the scroll CTA
**Then** a light haptic pulse MAY be triggered
**And** the feedback MUST be synchronized with the visual feedback

#### Scenario: Haptic feedback respects user preferences

**Given** haptic feedback is implemented
**When** checking for user preferences
**Then** the feedback MUST check for system haptic settings
**And** the feedback MUST be disabled if accessibility features indicate preference against haptics
**And** the application MUST provide a way to disable haptics

### Requirement: Touch-Specific CSS Optimizations

The page MUST include CSS optimizations specifically for touch devices.

#### Scenario: Touch action is optimized

**Given** the carousel is rendered on mobile
**When** checking the CSS
**Then** the carousel MUST have `touch-action: pan-x` to allow only horizontal scrolling
**And** buttons/links MUST have `touch-action: manipulation` to eliminate tap delay
**And** interactive elements MUST have `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`

#### Scenario: Webkit overflow scrolling is enabled

**Given** the carousel uses overflow scrolling
**When** on iOS Safari or Webkit browsers
**Then** the carousel MUST have `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
**And** momentum scrolling MUST be enabled
**And** the scroll MUST feel native to the platform

#### Scenario: User select is controlled

**Given** the user is interacting with the carousel
**When** touching and dragging
**Then** text selection MUST be disabled with `user-select: none`
**And** images MUST not be draggable with `user-drag: none`
**And** the experience MUST feel like native scrolling

### Requirement: Touch-Optimized Animations

All animations triggered by touch MUST be optimized for mobile performance.

#### Scenario: Animations use GPU acceleration

**Given** an animation is triggered by touch interaction
**When** the animation runs
**Then** the animation MUST use CSS transforms (translate, scale, rotate)
**And** the animation MUST use opacity changes
**And** the animation MUST NOT use position, margin, padding, width, or height
**And** the animation MUST have `will-change` hint applied appropriately

#### Scenario: Animations maintain 60fps on mobile

**Given** an animation is running on a mobile device
**When** measuring frame rate
**Then** the animation MUST maintain 60fps or higher
**And** no frame drops MUST occur during the animation
**And** the animation MUST not cause layout thrashing
**And** the animation MUST complete within the expected duration

### Requirement: Touch Accessibility

Touch interactions MUST remain accessible to users with motor impairments or assistive technologies.

#### Scenario: Touch targets accommodate motor impairments

**Given** a user has motor control difficulties
**When** interacting with touch targets
**Then** all targets MUST exceed the 44x44pt minimum
**And** targets MAY be larger (48x48pt or 56x56pt) for critical actions
**And** spacing between targets MUST prevent accidental taps

#### Scenario: Long press provides alternatives

**Given** the user has difficulty with precise taps
**When** the user long-presses an element
**Then** an alternative action MAY be provided (context menu, tooltip, etc.)
**Or** the same action MUST be triggered reliably

#### Scenario: Touch works with assistive technologies

**Given** a user is using screen reader touch mode (e.g., VoiceOver)
**When** the user double-taps to activate an element
**Then** the element MUST respond as if directly tapped
**And** the element MUST announce its state before and after activation
**And** the element MUST provide appropriate feedback
